# StyleRecognitioninMusic
As a part of my Master's thesis I built a system with JAVA that generates a a good approximation of the Context Free Grammar (CFG) of a string. Although It can be used for the CFG of any string, I've set up my higher level function to produce CFG for music represented as sequence of MIDI pitches. This could include the timing details, but it's not mandatory. The system then uses the CFG's "size" to approximate the Kolmogorov Complexity of the string, K(x). This K(x) then helps us to compute the Normalized Compression Distance between each pair of string x and y, and cluster the music in groups of composers, genre etc.
